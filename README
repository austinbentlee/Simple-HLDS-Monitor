This monitors HLDS by sending a UDP packet to retrieve the host's HLDS game title and player count. If neither of these are received within 1 second, it will shoot off an email to you. 

----- SETUP -----

First, you'll want to set up the mail command to start working. You can configure it to work with Google's SMTP, but you will have to whitelist the FROM address in your inbox.

Second, you'll want to modify "run.sh" to have the correct HLDS host and port(s). You'll also want to change the email so you receive the alerts.

Finally, test run.sh. If it works, add it as a periodic cronjob so you can know when your server goes down!
